# Linked List

It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains data, and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.

A drawback of linked lists is that data access time is linear in respect to the number of nodes in the list.

Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.

## Types

## Space and Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Auxiliary Space |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Insertion | O(n)            | O(1)            |
| Deletion  | O(n)            | O(1)            |
| Searching | O(n)            | O(1)            |
